"Name was given because of the cause"

A basic Steganography project which takes picture or audio as an input (.jpeg,.mp3) and a message (text or picture(<1MB)) then
supplies the carrier which can be sent accross the network.
Once the carrier message is received it can be again deconstructed to give the message.
It contains a GUI package based upon the JAVAFx pages which supplies user a comfortable look & feel of application.

For successfully deploying this project you need to setup the environment as follows.

1.Using the NETBEANS 7.2 RC2.

2.Including all the jar files of project.

3.We used java fx builder for developing the UI of the project.

4.Use of basic audio supported jar files like jlayer1.0.1 for the displaying picture and running the audio files.
